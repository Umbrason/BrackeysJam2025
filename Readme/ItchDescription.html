<h1 style="text-align:center;">Feedback & Updates</h1>
<p style="width:50%;margin:auto;"> 
Hey all, we've seen your feedback and also did some playtesting ourselves and decided to update the game to reflect that.<br>
This includes the <strong>unified controls</strong> as well as the <strong>balance of the early game</strong>, but more on that at the bottom of this page...
</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Buggy Bot</h1>
<p style="width:980px; margin: 0px -20px 0px -20px"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Umbrason/BrackeysJam2025/refs/heads/main/Readme/GeneralGameplay.gif" style="display: block; width: 100%;"></p>
<p style="width:70%;margin:auto;">
In <strong>Buggy Bot</strong> you play as a tiny robot beetle, created by a very mad and very busy scientist.<br>
Because he is a very mad and very busy scientist he has abandoned you alone in his backyard with all of his other creations.</p>
<p style="width:980px; margin: 0px -20px 0px -20px"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Umbrason/BrackeysJam2025/refs/heads/main/Readme/characters.gif" style="display: block; width: 100%;"></p>
<p style="width:70%;margin:auto;">
Now you have to fend for yourself against all of the other mad denizens of this rusty old place full of trash.

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Friendly Fire</h1>
<p style="width:980px; margin: 0px -20px 0px -20px"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Umbrason/BrackeysJam2025/refs/heads/main/Readme/FriendlyFire.gif" style="display: block; width: 100%;"></p>
<p style="width:70%;margin:auto;">
Beware, the bullets you shoot to defend yourself from all the other crazy robots, that your creator has thrown into his back yard, bounce off of the trash lying around and <em>might just come back to hit you instead</em>.<br>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Upgrades</h1>

<p style="width:70%;margin:auto;">
In his merciful madness your scientist creator has given you the ability to assimilate items from the trash heap to upgrade your capabilities.

<br>
Some upgrades can be very impactful to your enemies, but also yourself!<br>
So make sure you choose wisely to stay in one piece for as long as you. How strong do you <em>dare</em> to get before you yourself become your biggest threat?

<h2 style="text-align:center;margin:0px 0px 16px 0px">Alternative Control Scheme</h2>
<p style="width:70%;margin:auto;">
We have gotten a lot of feedback regarding the unified movement and shooting direction and while that decision was made to enforce the theme of the Jam, we too think that Buggy Bot can be a lot more fun with split controls.</p>
<p style="width:70%;margin:auto;">
Therefore we decided to offer a separate, more traditional, “Twin-Stick” control scheme version of Buggy Bot for both Windows and Linux, with split aim and movement directions using either 'WASD' for movement and the Mouse to aim or the Left&Right-Stick for controller input.<br>
Due to this alternative control scheme having a large impact on the difficulty of the game, this version has a separate online leaderboard.

<h2 style="text-align:center;margin:0px 0px 16px 0px">Balance Patch</h2>
<p style="width:70%;margin:auto;">
Since the end of the jam we have been busy playtesting, polishing and listening to your feedback on the balance of the game and found that especially the early game of our game tended to not be very exiting. It takes a while for your projectiles to actually pose a meaningful threat to yourself, especially with the split controls, and the enemies just take too long to destroy.<br>
We also found that once you get to these later stages where your own projectiles pose a meaningful threat to yourself, you are basically not able to dodge them anymore, so we have decided to slow them down quite a bit.
All of these changes, as well as a couple other minor tweaks and bugfixes are available for download in the 'Rebalanced' version for both Windows and Linux.
